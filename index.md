## Welcome to Sky Include

Own Your Piece of the Internet

SkyInclude Helps You Ensure You Are Part of the New Internet

Be an Early Adopter and Claim Your TLD of the decentralized web



## Disrupting the old DNS

DNS (Domain Name Service) is using the old internet and a closed system controlled by a few.

Yet the internet is meant to be an open web.

Wouldn’t it be nice to have a blockchain enabled DNS? One that isn’t controlled by large private corporations who rent to use their domain naming system on a yearly basis?



## In comes HNS

Handshake, and Namebase is leading the charge - to create a blockchain enabled DNS called HNS. 


HNS is the coin, the currency, that enables this to be made and maintained.
