## About Us

The idea of Sky Include is - a bridge between the current (old DNS) internet and the new (blockchain / Handshake / HNS) internet. 

The name Sky Include means, we help include as many people get onto the Sky. Into the future.

It is like the concept of leaving a failing planet and you are trying to reach for the sky to be included.

The logo represents a man, a hand, reaching out to the sky to be included in the new internet, the decentralized web. He is reaching out from the old, decaying, corrupt internet - and yearning to be included in the new world.

Join us in this new world, and let SkyInclude help you do so (if you so desire). Of course, you can do it on your own, be we are your helping hand in bridging you to the new sky.
